Though he appeared at his first DEF CON because of the Capture the Flag contest, Roamer and HighWiz showed him how to make DEF CON so much more than simply attending the talks.  From then on he made a point to participate in as much as he could.  Of course, this was all within the limits of social anxiety so, if it allowed participation as a wallflower, he was in!  Now, he wants to make sure everyone else gets to know as much as possible about this year's conference.  In his private life, Mike hacks managers and is happy anyone listens to him at all.\nwiseacre_mike"

Dr. Greenstadt was among the first to explore the effect of adversarial attacks on stylometric methods, and the first to demonstrate empirically how stylometric methods can fail in adversarial settings while succeeding in non-adversarial settings. \nShe has a history of speaking at hacker conferences including DEF CON 14, ShmooCon 2009, 31C3, and 32C3. \nDr. Greenstadt's scholarship has been recognized by the privacy research community. She is an alum of the DARPA Computer Science Study Group and a recipient of the NSF CAREER Award. Her work has received the PET Award for Outstanding Research in Privacy Enhancing Technologies and the Andreas Pfitzmann Best Student Paper Award. She currently serves as co-editor-in-chief of the journal Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PoPETs).  Her research has been featured in the New York Times, the New Republic, Der Spiegel, and other local and international media outlets.\n@ragreens"

Her research interests include the emerging science of bias in machine learning, fairness in artificial intelligence, data privacy, and security. Her work aims to characterize and quantify aspects of natural and artificial intelligence using a multitude of machine learning and language processing techniques. In her recent publication in Science, she demonstrated how semantics derived from language corpora contain human-like biases. In addition, she developed novel privacy attacks to de-anonymize programmers using code stylometry. Her presentations on both de-anonymization and bias in machine learning are the recipients of best talk awards. Her work on semi-automated anonymization of writing style furthermore received the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium Best Paper Award. Her research has received extensive press coverage across the globe. Aylin holds a PhD in Computer Science from Drexel University and a Master of Science in Robotics from the University of Pennsylvania.

Weld was the webmaster of the l0pht.com website where all those hacker t-files from the BBS era could be found. Weld worked on the software side of L0pht researching vulnerabilities, writing advisories, building Netcat for Windows, and making L0phtCrack the first password cracker with a GUI. Weld was part of the 7 person group that testified at the US Senate in 1998 where he spoke about software transparency and liability. He joined @stake with the L0pht acquisition and worked there managing the research team and consulting at top customers like Microsoft until @stake was purchased by Symantec. Weld and Dildog then spun out the @stake static binary analysis technology to create Veracode, where he is co-founder and CTO.\n@weldpond"
